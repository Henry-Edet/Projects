          02-24 - <b>CodeCrafters Tech Community Co-Founder (NEU)</b><br/>
          In order to create relevance of some sort, i found a major problem students both old and new<br/>
          faced. The new ones lacked the necessary skills and guidance to navigate the world they had entered;<br/>
          whilst the old ones were not able to find a way to give back to the community. I co-founded a tech community<br/>
          to bridge this gap. I was able to gather a few students and we started organizing events, hackathons.<br/>
          The blog section will have images of our first ever public event (CCO) in May, 2024. <br/>
          We pulled resources together and built a delivery drone which was our biggest feat yet.<br/>
