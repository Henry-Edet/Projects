Codecrafters Orientation was the first ever public event/appearance for Codecrafters.


It turned out to be a very successful event with over a 100 attendees, we gave an opportunity to every founding admin member to speak and introduce themselves.


I had the privilege of taking photos with the founding admins all of whom were hand picked by me<br/> except for my co-founder Dr priscilla at the very center of the photo.

I spoke on the basics of coding and how to think like an Engineer.

During the session i had the privilege of asking questions and picking their brains <br/>to ascertain how they viewed the tech industry as a whole regardless of coding.

This orientation helped sharpen my leadership skills and helped me connect with people on a more
realistic level. Understanding what made them choose their field of study and guiding them through<br/>
every step has been fulfilling.
